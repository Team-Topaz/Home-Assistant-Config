Some notes for my Sonoff setup:
- I've set up time and timezones so that I can run time-based automations directly on the devices.
  - TimeSTD 0,1,11,1,2,-480 Sets standard time
  - TimeDST 0,2,3,1,2,-420 Sets DST
  - Timezone 99 Enables using DST settings
  - NtpServer1 192.168.1.1 Use my local NTP server
- Automatic restart: rule1 on Time#Minute=120 do Restart 1
  - Currently only set on bike room lamp
- Disable Serial output once tested and working
  - seriallog 0
- While they've all been loaded with customized firmware, I've configured them in such a way that standard Tasmota upgrades should be safe.
  - Exception: TV Backlight runs a variant which needs DMA For WS2812 enabled.
- I have some iFan02s!
  - I set PowerOnState 0
    - Originally this was to fix an issue. Now I just want it to start off.
  - Discovery doesn't seem to work for the fan, so I named each controller something like "office light," then manually added the fan to HASS.
  - PowerRetain 1
    - This makes it so restarts of Home Assistant keep proper fan state.
