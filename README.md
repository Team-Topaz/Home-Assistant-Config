# Home-Assistant-Config

My own Home Assistant configuration! I'm doing a lot of things in here, and it's badly organized because I basically just separate by component, not by logical function.

Major Components:
- Lutron Caseta Wireless dimmers
- Custom multisensors (https://github.com/bruhautomation/ESP-MQTT-JSON-Multisensor)
- Logitech Harmony Hub
- Owntracks/MQTT for device tracking
- Sonoff outlets
- RfLink Gateway for 433MHz control (new, badly implemented)
- Misc other stuff
