# Home Assistant Configuration

My own Home Assistant configuration! I'm doing a lot of things in here, and it's badly organized because I basically just separate by component, not by logical function.

#### Major Components:
- Lutron Caseta Wireless dimmers
- esphomeyaml multisensors
- Logitech Harmony Hub
- Owntracks/MQTT for device tracking
- Sonoff outlets (https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota)
- RfLink Gateway for 433MHz control (http://rflink.nl/)
  - This is very new, and very badly implemented.
- Misc other stuff
