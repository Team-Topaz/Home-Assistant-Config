#Tasks for keeping Home Assistant running well.

#This auto-restarts Home Assistant. Rethink a bit? It's OK to restart when we're asleep.
#There's an uptime restriction in conditions to prevent a condition where HASS bootloops.
#There are some other problems:
# 1. Certain things, like the sunrise alarm, might lose their settings.
# 2. We need to not be on vacation or vacation mode will disable.
